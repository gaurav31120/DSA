Array DSA Question Patterns

1) Elementary Traversal and Modification
        Sum of elements
        Finding minimum/maximum
        Counting occurrences of an element
        Reversing an array
        Rotate an array

2) Sorting and Searching
        Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap)
        Binary search on sorted arrays
        Counting sort (for special cases where elements are in a limited range)
        Search for a given element (linear and binary search)
        Find the kth smallest/largest element

3) Two-pointer Techniques
        Finding pairs with a specific sum (e.g., two sum problem)
        Reversing an array in-place
        Merging two sorted arrays
        Partitioning an array (used in quicksort)
        Sliding window problems (e.g., maximum sum subarray of size k)

4) Dynamic Programming
        Maximum/Minimum sum subarray
        Longest increasing subsequence
        Coin change problem
        Knapsack problem variants
        Number of ways to sum up to a target (subset sum problem)

5) Hashing and Counting
        Frequency count of elements
        Finding duplicates or missing numbers
        Grouping or categorizing data
        Longest consecutive sequence

6) Divide and Conquer
        Quick sort
        Merge sort
        Binary search
        Find peak element
        Closest pair of points (using divide and conquer in multidimensional arrays)

7) Matrix Problems
        Matrix rotation and flipping
        Spiral order traversal
        Searching in a row-wise and column-wise sorted matrix
        Matrix multiplication
        Path finding problems (e.g., number of paths from top-left to bottom-right)

8) Cycle Detection
        Detecting cycle in an array (Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare)
        Find the repeating and missing numbers

9) Miscellaneous Complex Patterns
        Rearrange array according to given indexes
        Rearrange array in-place with O(1) extra space
        Shuffle an array
        Stock buy and sell to maximize profit (single or multiple transactions)
        Reorder array according to given indexes

10) Stacks and Queues using Arrays
        Next greater/smaller element
        Implementing a min-stack
        Implementing queues using stacks and vice versa
        Histogram related problems (e.g., largest rectangle in histogram)
        
11) Graph-related
        Adjacency matrix representation and operations
        Transitive closure of a graph (using Floyd-Warshall algorithm )
        Shortest path in weighted/unweighted graph
